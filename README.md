# GahezDemo
This Demo app is for showing restaurants in the first screen using MVVM Design pattern and Combine framework and the second screen is to show the details of the selected restaurants 

All UI in the app is made by code and no storyboards used in the app

You can sort the results by pressing the Button SORT BY DISTANCE

I added a system for cashing images by NSCache in the file CachedImageView which will increase the loading of the images

A test is added for checking the json data returned from the Api and to check the MVVM workflow and JSON fetching
